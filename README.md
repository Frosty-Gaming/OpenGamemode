# OpenGamemode
OpenGamemode is a clone of the Sandbox gamemode included with Garry's Mod. Anybody can commit to this repo and it will be automatically cloned every 2 hours on the server hosted by Frosty Gaming (or, at least it will in the future)

## Rules
1. No crashing the server or other peoples' clients with your code
2. No committing offensive or illegal content such as pornograhpic images
3. No sending data to any outside source. This includes HTTP requests to your own server
4. All data which needs to be stored should use the built-in SQL functions and PData. This may be changed in the future.
5. Any non-productive code (such as code which will dump a load of crap into the data folder) will not be accepted
